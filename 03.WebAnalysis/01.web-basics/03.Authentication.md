<h3> what is JWT? </h3>

JSON Web Token(JWT) is an open standard (RFC7519) for securely transmitting information between endpoints as JSON Objects. It is mainly
used to prove that the sent data was actually created by authentic source.

JWT Consists Of Three Concatenated Base64Url-Encoded strings, separated by dots (.)

They Are:

1. Header
2. Payload
3. Signature

<h5> A JWT Typically looks like:</h5>

    xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz

<h5> 1. Header: </h5>

The First Part Typically Consists Of Two Parts; the type of the token, which is JWT, and the signing algorithm being used such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA.
If you don’t define the algorithm, it uses HS256 by default.

    For example:

        {

            “alg”: “HS256”,
            “typ”: “JWT”
        }

<h5> 2. Payload: </h5>

The second part consists of a set of claims that are basically verifiable security statements, such as the identity of the user and the permissions they are allowed.

There are three types of claims: registered, public, and private claims. Note that the claim names are short as JWT is meant to be compact for fast requests.

And wait! Be careful not to put sensitive data such as passwords in your payload as this can easily be decoded.

    An example payload could be:

        {
            “sub”: “123456789”,
            “name”: “Will Smith”,
            “admin”: true
        }

<h5> 3. Signature: </h5>

The last part is the signature which is the sum of the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, and lastly, the algorithm which is specified in the header.

For example, if you want to use the HS256 algorithm, the signature would be created in the following way:

        HS256 (
                base64UrlEncode(header) + “.” +
                base64UrlEncode(payload),
                secret

              )

The signature is used to verify the message wasn’t changed along the way. It is the most important part of the JWT structure as header and payload can easily be decoded, but not the signature.

The signature is not publicly readable because it is encrypted with a secret key. Unless someone has the secret key, they cannot decrypt this information.
