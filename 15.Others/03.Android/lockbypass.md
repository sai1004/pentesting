Steps:-

   1. Connect your android phone to you computer.

   2. Open Commande prompt administrator.

   3. Now in command prompt window type following code carefully:
   
   adb shell cd/data/data/com.android.providers.settings/databases sqlites settings.db  update system set value=0 where name=’lockpatternautolock’; update system set value=0 where name=’lockscreen.lockedoutpermanently’; .quit

   4. Now you will see some screen as shown below and then you can reboot your phone and now when your android starts again, then try unlocking it using any random pattern and it will unlock and work pretty fine.

   5. If you face any problem repeat same steps but instead of the above code tru using  adb shell rm/data/system/gesture.key and the press enter and now reboot your device to see if it works.
