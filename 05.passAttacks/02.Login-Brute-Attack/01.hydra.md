So open your console application. Of course, you start with the executable name, Hydra, followed by -s argument which designates the port to be used. Also, it does not need to be entered when the default port is intended to be you. But let’s be honest, by adding it removes any ambiguities and also, it speeds up testing.

Command:

    hydra -s 22 -v -V -l root -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -t 8 192.168.0.115 ssh

Where:

    The -v, lower-case and upper case are for maximum verbosity.
    The -l selects the login name,
    The -P selects a password file path,
    The -t arguments select the number of parallel tasks or connections. The greater the number, the faster the test will occur, followed by the victim’s metasploitable IP address.
    And finally, the protocol name is SSH.
    Finally, press Enter. Check this out. Password cracked successfully.
